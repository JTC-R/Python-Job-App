# Python-Jobs-App
This program is a project by Justin Cocco. It is designed to web-scrape various job-hunting websites with user-input. The user is able to specify the websites they
want searched, the type of jobs, the amount of queries, and set the location for the search. As of now, the websites searched are:
  - Monster.com, 
  - Indeed.com, 
  - Gettinghired.com, 
  - Flexjobs.com, 
  - Snagajob.com, and
  - Glassdoor.com

All websites except for Glassdoor are straight-forward scrapes. However, Glassdoor has safeguards that have to be overcome - thus the prolonged mechanism
for the creation of the appropriate Glassdoor URL can be noted.
